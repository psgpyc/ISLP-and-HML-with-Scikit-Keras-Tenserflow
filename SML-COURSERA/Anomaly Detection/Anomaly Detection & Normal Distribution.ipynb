    "## Overview of Anomaly Detection\n",

    "## Role of Normal Distribution in Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection assumes that the features of \"normal\" data are distributed in a certain way, often following a **Gaussian (normal) distribution**. Here's how it is applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Fit a Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "For each feature in the dataset (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption), we:\n",
    "1. Estimate the **mean** ($\\mu$) and **variance** ($\\sigma^2$) of the feature.\n",
    "2. Assume the data is drawn from a normal distribution, modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma_i^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x_i - \\mu_i)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $x_i$: A feature value\n",
    "- $\\mu_i$: Mean of the feature\n",
    "- $\\sigma_i^2$: Variance of the feature\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Compute the Probability of a Data Point\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if a data point $x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ is anomalous:\n",
    "- Compute the joint probability $p(x)$ assuming independence of features:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p(x_i)$ is the probability of each feature value $x_i$ under the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Define an Anomaly Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set a threshold $\\epsilon$ for the probability.\n",
    "- If:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) < \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "classify the point as an **anomaly**; otherwise, classify it as **normal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Normal Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is commonly used in anomaly detection because:\n",
    "1. **Many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution** (e.g., heights, weights, sensor readings).\n",
    "2. It is mathematically convenient and computationally efficient to calculate probabilities.\n",
    "3. When features are approximately Gaussian, this method works well to model typical behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example: Monitoring Server Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're monitoring server metrics for anomalies:\n",
    "- **Feature 1**: CPU usage\n",
    "- **Feature 2**: Memory usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Collect \"normal\" data (e.g., server metrics during normal operation).\n",
    "2. Fit a Gaussian distribution for each feature:\n",
    "   - Calculate $\\mu_{CPU}$, $\\sigma_{CPU}^2$, $\\mu_{Memory}$, and $\\sigma_{Memory}^2$.\n",
    "3. Compute $p(x)$ for new data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = p(CPU) \\cdot p(Memory)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare $p(x)$ with the threshold $\\epsilon$:\n",
    "   - If $p(x) < \\epsilon$, raise an alert for an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes \n",
    "\n",
    "key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Threshold ($\\epsilon$)**:\n",
    "   - Picking the right threshold is critical.\n",
    "   - Too high or too low a threshold can result in too many false positives or negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multivariate Gaussian**:\n",
    "   - If features are correlated, use a **multivariate Gaussian distribution** instead of assuming independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal Distribution** helps model the expected behaviour of data.\n",
    "- **Anomalies** are identified as data points that have a low probability under the assumed Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "- This statistical approach is simple, efficient, and widely used in real-world anomaly detection systems.\n",
