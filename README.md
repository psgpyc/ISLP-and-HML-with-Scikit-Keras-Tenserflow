## About

This repository contains personal solutions, implementations, and notes from the following machine learning resources:

- **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**: Solutions and exercises from the book by Aurélien Géron.
- **An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python (ISLP)**: Solutions and exercises from the book by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jonathan Taylor.
- **Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course**: Solutions and implementations from the Coursera course.
- **Models From Scratch**: Implementations of machine learning models from scratch, including fundamental algorithms.

These solutions serve as a reference for anyone working through the books or courses, with code and explanations included for better understanding.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `HML/`: Resources and solutions from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow."
- `ISLP/`: Solutions from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python (ISLP)."
- `ML-Coursera/`: Solutions and projects from Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera.
- `Models From Scratch/`: Implementations of machine learning models built from scratch, without using pre-built libraries.

Each folder contains scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and datasets related to the respective resource.
