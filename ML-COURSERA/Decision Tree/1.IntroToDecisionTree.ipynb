    "## 1. Process of Building a Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Decide the Feature for the Root Node\n",
    "- The root node is the topmost node of the decision tree.\n",
    "- Use an algorithm to determine the feature to split on.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Split on **ear shape**:\n",
    "    - **Left branch**: Pointy ears.\n",
    "    - **Right branch**: Floppy ears.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Split the Data Recursively\n",
    "- Focus on each branch and decide the next feature to split on.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - **Left branch** splits on **face shape**:\n",
    "    - **Left**: Round faces → All cats → Leaf node prediction = Cat.\n",
    "    - **Right**: Not round faces → All dogs → Leaf node prediction = Not cat.\n",
    "  - **Right branch** splits on **whiskers**:\n",
    "    - **Left**: Whiskers present → All cats → Leaf node prediction = Cat.\n",
    "    - **Right**: Whiskers absent → All dogs → Leaf node prediction = Not cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create Leaf Nodes\n",
    "- Stop splitting when subsets are \"pure\" (contain only one class, e.g., all cats or all dogs).\n",
    "- Make predictions at leaf nodes based on the class composition.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Key Decisions in Building a Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Choosing the Feature to Split On\n",
    "- Decide which feature (e.g., ear shape, face shape, whiskers) to split on.\n",
    "- **Aim**: Maximise **purity** in the resulting subsets.\n",
    "- **Purity**:\n",
    "  - A \"pure\" subset contains examples of only one class.\n",
    "  - Example: Splitting on a hypothetical \"cat DNA\" feature would achieve 100% purity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Stopping Criteria for Splitting\n",
    "- **Purity threshold**: Stop splitting when subsets are completely pure.\n",
    "- **Maximum tree depth**: Limit the tree's depth to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "  - **Depth**: Number of hops from the root node to the current node.\n",
    "  - Example: A maximum depth of 2 prevents splits beyond two levels.\n",
    "- **Minimum impurity gain**: Stop splitting if the improvement in purity is too small.\n",
    "- **Minimum examples at a node**: Stop splitting if the number of examples in a node falls below a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Challenges and Evolution of Decision Trees\n",
    "- Decision tree algorithms involve multiple components, making them appear complex:\n",
    "  - Feature selection criteria.\n",
    "  - Stopping conditions.\n",
    "  - Methods for measuring purity/impurity.\n",
    "- These complexities arose as researchers refined the algorithm over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Measuring Purity (or Impurity)\n",
    "- **Purity** determines the homogeneity of the examples in a subset.\n",
    "- **Entropy**: A mathematical measure of impurity.\n",
    "  - **Low entropy**: High purity (e.g., all examples are cats or dogs).\n",
    "  - **High entropy**: Low purity (e.g., a mix of cats and dogs).\n",
    "- Upcoming topics cover entropy and its role in decision-making for splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Selection**: A \"good\" feature reduces impurity, making subsets more homogenous.\n",
    "2. **Stopping Splits**: Prevents overfitting and ensures the tree generalises well.\n",
    "3. **Entropy and Purity**: Mathematical tools guide the algorithm to create effective splits.\n",
    "4. **Complexity of Decision Trees**: Despite their perceived messiness, decision trees are robust and effective for classification tasks."
