    "This is an algorithm that is commonly used for visualization. Specifically, if you have a dataset with a lot of features, say 10 features or 50 features or even thousands of features, you can't plot 1,000 dimensional data. PCA, or principal components analysis is an algorithm that lets you take data with a lot of features, 50, 1,000, even more, and reduce the number of features to two features, maybe three features, so that you can plot it and visualize it"
